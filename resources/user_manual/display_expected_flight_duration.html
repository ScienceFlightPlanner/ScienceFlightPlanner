    <h3>Display Expected Flight Duration</h3>
    <p> <img src="{ICON_FOLDER_PATH}/icon_duration.png"> </p>
    <p>
        When the above button is pressed and a line layer is selected (see FAQ), the expected duration (h) for flying
        along the flight plan in this layer is shown. While activated, the display of the flight duration updates in
        accordance to changes in the layer/feature selection (see FAQ). If the button is pressed again, the display of
        the duration is toggled. Whether the tool is activated, is indicated by toggling the button.
    </p>
    <p>
        The used flight speed can be set in the plugin settings (see FAQ) with a default speed set to 200km/h.
