    <h3>Convert Grid to Racetrack</h3>

    <p>
        The Racetrack feature calculates optimal waypoints for a plane when the designated button is pressed. These waypoints are determined based on the selected sensor, polygon-layer representing the area of interest, and flight altitude. Note that the selected polygon layer must contain only one feature.
    </p>

    <h4>Key Features of Waypoints</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Fly-over Tag:</strong> Each waypoint is assigned a fly-over tag by default.</li>
        <li><strong>Unique IDs:</strong> Waypoints are assigned unique IDs based on the selected algorithm, indicating the order in which they need to be flown over.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The algorithms are designed to optimize the flight path when flying over a grid. You can choose between two algorithms:</p>

    <h4>Back-and-Forth Algorithm</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The plane flies over the first <code>k</code> waypoints (determined by the maximum turning distance).</li>
        <li>It then flies back over <code>k-1</code> waypoints, reversing direction.</li>
        <li>This process repeats until the entire area is covered.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Top-to-Bottom Algorithm</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The plane flies over <code>k</code> waypoints repeatedly until it reaches the end of the grid.</li>
        <li>It then moves back by 1 waypoint.</li>
        <li>The plane continues flying <code>k</code> waypoints in the opposite direction, repeating the process until the grid is fully covered.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Suggested Naming for Output Files</h4>
    <p>
        The generated output files include the maximum turning distance in their filenames to make them easily identifiable.
