    <h3>Compute Optimal Coverage Lines</h3>
    <p> <img src=":resources/icons/icon_coverage_lines.png"></p>
    <p>
        When the above button is pressed, optimal flight lines are computed given a sensor and a polygon, representing
        an area of interest, are selected.
        These lines can be used as a template for a flight plan over the area of interest which for the selected sensor
        has some amount of overlap with as few turns as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        The flight altitude can be changed in the flight altitude SpinBox in the toolbar and sensors can be added,
        deleted or changed in the plugin settings (see FAQ).
    </p>
    <p>
        The amount of overlap which is considered when creating the optimal flight lines can also be changed in the
        plugin settings. Overlap means how much adjacent coverage segments overlap each other (see example below).

    <p><u>0% overlap</u></p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p><u>50% overlap</u></p>
    <p>
        <img src=":resources/user_manual/overlap_50_percent.png" width=auto height="150">
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, it is possible to use two different settings for the line computations. The default setting, which
        we strongly suggest to use, is called "optimal". In this case the lines are optimal w.r.t. the criteria
        described above. Choosing "90° rotated" means that the lines are 90° rotated from the optimal orientation.
        Therefore, they are no longer optimal but depending on the flight plan and use case this might still be useful.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to use this feature for the first time it is necessary to set the CRS used for coverage computations in
        the plugin settings. The CRS should be compatible with the region of the QGIS project.
