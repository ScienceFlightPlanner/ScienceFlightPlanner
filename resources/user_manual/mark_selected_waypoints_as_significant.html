    <h3>Mark selected Waypoints as Significant </h3>
    <p> <img src=":resources/icons/icon_highlight.png"></p>
    <p>
        When the above button is pressed and some waypoints are selected (see FAQ) they are marked as significant. This
        means a field "sig" is added to the attribute table of the points which you have to confirm.
    </p>
    <p>
        Afterwards each significant point is marked with a little star.
