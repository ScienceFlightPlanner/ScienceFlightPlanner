    <h3>Generate Waypoints for Flight Plan</h3>
    <p><img src="{ICON_FOLDER_PATH}/icon_file.png"></p>
    <p>
        When the above button is pressed and a line layer is selected (see FAQ), all waypoints of this layer's flight
        plan are extracted. A waypoint is defined as each point in the flight path where the flight changes direction.
    </p>
    <p>A window will pop up in which you can set the name and location of the shp-file in which the extracted waypoints
        will be stored as points.</p>
