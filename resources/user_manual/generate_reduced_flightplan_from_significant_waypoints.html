        When the above button is pressed and waypoints in the current layer were previously marked as significant, i.e.
        the flight plan layer has the field "sig", as generated by "Mark selected Waypoints as Significant", the
        waypoints chosen to be significant will be saved in a new shp-file. The points in the new shp-file have ids
        according to their position in the original flight plan.
