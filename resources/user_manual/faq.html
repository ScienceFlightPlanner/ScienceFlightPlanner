    <h3>FAQ</h3>
    <h4>What does it mean that some feature has to be selected?</h4>
    <p>
        This means, that either the feature is the only feature in the current layer or the feature is selected with the
        QGIS selection tool which can be found in the standard toolbar ("Selection Toolbar") or via "Edit ▶ Select".
    </p>
    <h4>How can I select multiple features?</h4>
    <p>
        Especially when you want to mark multiple points as significant it is useful to select multiple points. To
        select multiple points, press and hold the "CRTL" key (on Mac: "Command" key) and click on the features you want
        to select.
    </p>
    <h4>Where can the plugin settings be found?</h4>
    <p>
        The plugin setting can be found under: "Settings ▶ Options... ▶ ScienceFlightPlanner". <br> There it is possible
        to change the flight speed, the CRS used for computing sensor coverage, the setting used for computing overlap
        and to add, delete or change sensors.
    </p>
    <h4>I've activated the flight duration/distance display, how is it updated?</h4>
    <p>
        When the flight duration/distance display is activated (indicated by a toggled button of the corresponding
        feature) the distance/duration is updated in accordance to the current layer/feature selection. This means that
        when for example changing the layer to a different line layer, the distance/duration is updated to match the new
        layer.
        If the layer contains multiple features, it is required to explicitly select one feature for which the
        distance/duration is to be shown. Similarly, as for a new layer selection, a new feature selection within the
        current layer results in an update of the distance/duration.
        When a layer of a geometry other than line is selected, the display is toggled until a layer of type line is
        selected again.
