    <h3>Show Coverage</h3>
    <p>
        When a line layer is selected (see FAQ) and a sensor in the sensor selection box of the plugin toolbar is
        selected, a new shp-file will be created containing the area which is covered by the flight plan in the layer
        for a specific flight altitude and the selected sensor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given a coverage shp-file has been created for the current flight plan and sensor, changing the flight altitude
        or the sensor settings results in an update of the corresponding coverage shp-file.
        The flight altitude can be changed in the flight altitude SpinBox in the plugin's toolbar.
        Sensors can be added, deleted or changed in the plugin settings (see FAQ).
    </p>
    <p>
        Before this feature can be used, it is necessary to set the CRS used for coverage computations in the plugin
        settings. The CRS should be compatible with the region of the QGIS project.
